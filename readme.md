# Layered Layout 
Author: Jaroslav Kuchar

<a href="https://gephi.org/plugins/layered-layout/">Layered Layout</a> plugin for <a href="http://www.gephi.org">Gephi</a>. 
This plugin provides layout, where nodes are in different layers (orbits). Assignment of node to layer depends on the value of numerical attribute of node. This layout can very nicely visualize the "Small-World Phenomenon", where the layer assignement depends on the distance between key node and the others (Erd√∂s number in the SNA Metrics Plugin).

# Tutorial
You can use this layout to visualize "The small-world phenomenon" or other situations. Plugin allows select attribute, 
which will be used as identifier of layer. Layer distance is distance between each two layers. And "Adjust" possibility allows spread nodes around layer.
